### 2. Data Cleaning 🧹:
Data cleaning is like tidying up a messy room before guests arrive. It involves finding and fixing mistakes, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in a dataset, making it reliable and easy to work with. By cleaning the data, we're essentially turning a chaotic pile of information into a neat and organized format, which allows organizations to analyze it more effectively, make better decisions, and uncover valuable insights.
### 3. Data Processing 🚴‍♂️:
Data processing involves transforming raw data into a meaningful and structured format to extract valuable insights.This steps included data transformation,feature engineering, and handling missing values,making the dataset more amenable to analysis.
### 4. Data Modeling 💻:

Data modeling is the process of creating a structured representation of data to facilitate storage,the team created Doctor's Detail Tables.This data modeling step stramlined the analysis process,enabling efficient ectraction of insights.After these steps we get a proper Table,here one of table it is


### 6. ExcelDashboard📰:
An Excel dashboard is a visual representation of data using charts, graphs, and tables, providing a concise and interactive way to monitor and analyze key metrics and trends.
### Project Impact 📈
