#MOdel Building on Doctors's Fee Prediction 📂:
Model Building on Doctors's Fee Prediction:Utilizing data sourced from Practo.com, India's leading integrated healthcare company, our team of data scientists, machine learning engineers, and domain experts embarked on a comprehensive project to predict doctors' fees. Through systematic collection and documentation of information, we aimed to develop a robust model for accurate fee estimation."This project was conceived and executed by a team of dedicated individuals,including Shubham pathak,Sachin Lanje, Sawrav Yadav, Vishwanath j, Farzeena P A under the expert guidence of Manish Hemnani.

## Project Phases:
### 1. Data Scraping :
The project initiated with the collection of raw data from the Practo.com.I extract the data using using Beautifulsoup and selenium libraries in python.This phase involve with web Scraping techniques to extract fee-related information,ensuring the foundation for subsequent analysis was solid.

### 2. Data Cleaning 🧹:
Data cleaning is like tidying up a messy room before guests arrive. It involves finding and fixing mistakes, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in a dataset, making it reliable and easy to work with. By cleaning the data, we're essentially turning a chaotic pile of information into a neat and organized format, which allows organizations to analyze it more effectively, make better decisions, and uncover valuable insights.
### 3. Data Processing 🚴‍♂️:
Data processing involves transforming raw data into a meaningful and structured format to extract valuable insights.This steps included data transformation,feature engineering, and handling missing values,making the dataset more amenable to analysis.
### 4. Data Modeling 💻:

Data modeling is the process of creating a structured representation of data to facilitate storage,the team created Doctor's Detail Tables.This data modeling step stramlined the analysis process,enabling efficient ectraction of insights.After these steps we get a proper Table,here one of table it is


### 6. ExcelDashboard📰:
An Excel dashboard is a visual representation of data using charts, graphs, and tables, providing a concise and interactive way to monitor and analyze key metrics and trends.
### Project Impact 📈
Practo's Doctors fee prediction enhances healthcare accessibility by providing accurate cost estimates, empowering patients to make informed decisions and manage medical expenses effectively.
